Run pdbmat and then diagstd and check that your results are (almost) the same as mines.

If you have a 32bits machine (to know that: getconf LONG_BIT), one of the
provided executables may work as is. Otherwise, you have to recompile them;
see the pdbmat.README and diagstd.README (worth looking there anyway).
