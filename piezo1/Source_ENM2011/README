pdbmat: Computes the Hessian for a structure, using an Elastic Network Model (ENM).

diagstd: Can diagonalize the Hessian produced by pdbmat. 
Each eigenvector obtained gives the amplitude of the motion for each particle (atom), for a given normal mode,
that is, a given frequency (the corresponding eigenvalue gives the square of the pulsation of the normal mode).
